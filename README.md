# UFOs

## Overview of Project

The analysis providede consists of creating a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.

This tool will be used to assist users that are looking for UFO sightings, and will also allow them to filter data based on spcific criteria.

## Results

Dana, in the final stae of the project, is to make sure you undestand how the filtering capabilities work and is fully comfortable working with the new feature on your own. I will divide the process in steps.

1. First, take a look at the screenshot provided below. It shows the whole dataset with no filtering so far:

2. When you type a filter in any field, the tabel automagically (yes, just like magic!) gets updated with the data typed in the filter. Let's type "ca" in the state filed and see what data is returned, after I click outside the filter field or hit "tab":

3. Now here it comes the best part: you can use more than one filter at a time! That means, if you and to see UFO sightings in California AND in with the triangle shape, we can type "triangle" in the shape field and it will get updated.

When you type a filter in any field, the table automagically (yes, just like magic!) gets updated with the data typed in the filter. Let's type "ca" in the state filed and see what data is returned:

Note that you can add filters in all the filter fields.

4. You can refresh the page to restart the filtering process ar any time.

## Summary

### New Design Drawback

Even thought the page is awesome, there is always room for improvement. One drawback in this new design is that we cannot add multiple filters on the same field, so if I can to see data from multiple states, for example, I would have to do two different filters, one for each state.

### Recomendations of Improvement

Some future developments can dramatically change the experience in our page, Here are some recommendations of capabilities that can be added:

1. Year Filter: Instead of searching only by one specific date, we could also filter data by year, as this will help users to search data in specifc years.

2. Date Range Filter: filtering data by date range would also help to expand the feature to search for ranges instead of specific values.

3. New Data Input: we can also create a page to allow the user to input data, that can be added to the database after you verify its accuracy.

4. Multiple Filter Input: lastly, we can also add the capability of filtering by multiple states, shapes, and countries, what will help the user to expand their filtering capabilites.
